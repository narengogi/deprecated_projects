### I started this project on the 4th of December when the results came out, I did the scraping part, then the data cleaning and then I thought I would plot the data later

#### The original plan was to correlate on a chloropleth, the land prices of the constituencies against the winning political party


##### This no longer interests me, however it was a good learning experience

Plus if there is one takeaway from this I think it would be that projects are better completed in one sitting

##### Note: I uploaded the scraped data on Kaggle
##### Note2: Some of the constituency names in the geojson data are wrong, I used a metric to match them
